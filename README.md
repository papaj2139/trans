### **install**

1. **download**

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/papaj2139/trans.git
     ```

2. **make it executable**
     ```bash
     cd trans
     chmod +x trans
     ```

3. **move it to a system wide location**
   - example `/usr/local/bin`:

     ```bash
     sudo mv trans /usr/local/bin/
     ```

4. **run**
   - now you can run it with:

     ```bash
     trans
     ```
   - OR you can also print a bigger version of the flag with 
     ```bash
     trans big
     ```
     
should work on almost every distro but only tested on debian and alpine
